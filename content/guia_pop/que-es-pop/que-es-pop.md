What is POP? 

POP involves understanding crime problems, implementing tailor-made solutions and evaluating their impact.

A POP approach assumes that the conventional responsibilities of the police still exist (i.e., the need to respond to incidents and investigate crimes), but that the police function is broader than simply enforcing the law and carrying out activities after a crime has been committed.

A problem can involve any (or combination of) crime and citizen security issues, whether high or low in volume, serious or less serious, or associated with criminal groups or individual offenders.

POP is real police work. POP provides you with the opportunity to directly do something about reducing crime. Many police say their experiences from working in POP have been the highlights of their careers

POP reduces crime. A systematic review of 34 POP studies showed they had an average effect of decreasing crime and disorder by about 34% - “POP is an effective strategy to reduce crime” (Hinkle et al., 2020) https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cl2.1089

The crime problem triangle: a crime problem has three core components—an offender, a victim (or some other target) and a place. This approach helps us to think in terms of the opportunity structure that relates to crime and that solving crime problems is not just about focusing attention on offenders, but also about focusing on victims, targets and places.
