A problem is a set of similar and recurring events that affect a neighbourhood or community. Problem solving is most effective when the problem has been correctly identified and specifically defined.

## What is the problem?

The first step is to identify if there really is a problem to solve. Ask the following questions:

- **Is the problem an increasing or persistent problem?**
	- Problems that are increasing or are persistent are the types of problems that require prioritised attention. If the problem is declining or occurs very occasionally it is probably less of a problem than other priorities.

- **Are the incidents similar?**
	- If the incidents associated with the problem are very varied, it will be difficult to find a solution that addresses all of them. Focus on a specific set of similar incidents

## What is our role?

Be clear on what your agency’s role is in solving the problem. If, for example, you work for the police and the problem to solve is to do with ‘young people hanging about on the streets in the area’, you have to determine what it is they are doing that is creating issues associated with crime and citizen security. By doing so, you will then be clear about the problem solving role the police should perform.

## Set the scene

Set the scene about the problem by using data and information from those who have some knowledge about the problem. Describe the scale of the problem (e.g., how many incidents there are each month) and what the problem involves.

## What do you hope to achieve?

Determine the outcomes you are hoping to achieve. For crime problems this is most likely to be a reduction in the problem, but for others it could be an improvement in reporting, a reduction in re-offending, an improvement in community engagement, or more specific such as a reduction in repeat victimisation of a particular group of people. Thinking about what you are hoping to achieve will focus your problem solving work.

## Scanning checklist

- [ ] What is the problem? Has the problem been clearly and specifically defined?
- [ ] Is it a problem? Is it increasing, persistent and who does it affect?
- [ ] What does the problem involve? What data has been used to describe the problem?
- [ ] What outcomes are you hoping for? What would success look like?
